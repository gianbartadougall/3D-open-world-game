Current Bugs

- trees flick in and out when zoomed out and rotating
- cannot change pitch in auto camera movements
- sometimes aeroplane camera AI will return NaN when calculating yaw of camera after changing direction, need to create a check for this
- randomize static entities has become inaccurate and is only applying general guidelines to the terrains SE's can spawn on
- When loading models, cannot chose a terrain other then the grass for the models to work on
  (I think this is because it takes to long for the computer to loop through and find possible locations)


current inefficiencies / things to change

- inefficent process calculating normals for the terrain as you call getpixel height to calc the height and
then you call get pixel height again to calc the normal
- blendmap must be changed in both loadTerrains and game loop for the blend map to properly update - change it so it just comes from one place


Things to add

- add ability to have more terrains the just red green, blue and black
- rule that static entities cannot grow on gradients larger then a certain amount,
- made the player fall if standing on a steep enough gradient
- more models
- day night cycle
- water
- Camera AI
- AI models
- collision detection

- BoundingBox - need to add a indicie list along with the the float list of vertecies telling open gl how to draw the vertecies. Also need to not just have minX, maxX etx
  need a vertex for all 8 points of bounding box. Then need to create a seperate renderer to be able to render these to the screen with potentially there own vertex and fragment shader'
  to be able to change the look and feel of the boundingbox



Performance

Randomize static entities (SE = Static entity, HR = height restriction)
- no SE can go on any texture but grass: 90 trees and 90 rocks in 2 milliseconds (800 max dist from origin)
- no SE can go on any texture but grass and rocks have HR of 0 - 5 and trees have HR of 5 - 20: 90 trees and 90 rocks in 13 milliseconds (800 max dist from origin):



Terrain generation
 - 77 milliseconds to generate terrain

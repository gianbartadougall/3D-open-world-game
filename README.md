# 3D-open-world-game

This is a fun project I started to begin learning how to create 3D games. The type of game I was going for was an open world style game. 

Current features
- models created in blender can be added to the game and manipulated
- General movement (walking jumping, looking etc)
- Terrrain manipulation (can change textures and height layouts of terrain)
- Functional lighting that calcultes appropriate specular, ambient and diffuse lighting on all objects and terrain
- AI camera that can film sections of the game in different modes

Current notes on the game are supplied in the READ_ME file under scr Folder
